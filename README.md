# Epsilon

Epsilon is an application for students from Fontys HBO-ICT education that are following open innovation.
These students usually have a personal course within Canvas (from Instructure), which contains all of their study submissions and acts as a portfolio of sorts.
During each semester, it is requested to take note of all KPI's which have been proven.
